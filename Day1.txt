Statistical Learning vs Machine Learning
Same Techniques
Statistical learning goes way back(Gauss was doing it in 1800)
Math and CS difference
ML involves algorithms driving the machines adapt (just making accurate prediction)
SL is static (just making analysis of the data model and how the variables are related)
Data---->Deduce Informed decisions------> Future Events
Struturing, Cleaning the data
Smaller data sets --> confidence goes down about the deduction

Importance of relationship between variable

2 fundamental about analyzing data
supervised -> response variable provided
unsupervised -> Lookin gfor any kind of relation in the data 

Given a data, say smtn interesting----------> Go for unsupervised learning

Supervised learning basic approach
y response variable
x predictor variable
Epsilon noise term (because of which makes it non deterministic) assume mean is  zero as it should not be biased
y=f(x)+epsilon
interpretability, we need to have fHat model, that is it needs to have a function(that is have a fuctional dependency)
yHat=fHat(x)
predicatbility, fHat need not have a model

In reality, y and yHat are random variable, y? because they are based on the dataset rndomly chosen and given
Var(Epsilon), cannot be controlled , and will always be there, cannot be eliminated hence, irreducible
(f(x)-fHat(x))square, is reducible
y = ax2+bx+c-> parametric works good with interpretablity, assumes something about f
nonparametric-> works good with Prediction

How to deduce the Accuracy of the model

MSE= 1/n sum((y-fHat(x))2)

Overfitting is bad, as model differs drasticallly for different training data set chosen 
Bias-Variance tradeoff
Variance: Whats varying is the actual model, small changes in training set leads to big changes in the model(fHat(x))
Bias: Making a big assumption about fHat(x)
Bias increases for decrease in paramter leading to decrease in variance
Overfitting occurs in the right side of the Bias-Variance curve (U-shaped)

Classification Problems
Misclassification percentage has to be looked upon

Unsupervised Learning
Assocation rules-> rules of the form, if x, y, and z happen then w will happen
Useful in stores and markt strategy
Clustering analysis
Principal Compnent Analysis-> Dimensional reduction
